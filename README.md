# BEOBenchmark
Building Energy Optimization (BEO) problem test bed for benchmarking black-box optimization algorithms. Idea is to provide common an easy accessible set of problems in the building energy context such that testing and comparing optimization algorithms becomes traceable. Previous studies in BEO usually use different and only few BEO problems, thus inhibiting general conclusions and fair comparisons. 

The first version BEOBenchmark_V1 is down here. But everyone interested is invited to collaborate to extend the test set with more representative BEO problems, also coded maybe in different platforms such as GenOpt and using other simulators such as Modelica. Right now all is in EnergyPlus as simulator and Rhinoceros 3D Grasshopper as software platform. An easy interface for connecting any optimization algorithm (library) to Grasshopper is given with the [FrOG](https://github.com/Tomalwo/FrOG) (**F**ramework **f**or **O**ptimization in **G**rasshopper) tool by T. Wortmann and A. Zuardin.
